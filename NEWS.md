# ggragged (development version)

* Added a vignette showing examples of usage in broader context.
* Fixed an issue that caused the package to fail to build (with an "argument is
  missing" error message) when an older version of ggplot2 was installed.
* Added new parameters `strips` and `axes` to facets that control whether strips
  and axes respectively are drawn between adjacent panels.

# ggragged 0.1.0

* Initial release.
